* Set is a Collection used to store multiple data. Set doesn't allow repetitive elements. That is, Set uses just non-repetitive
elements. When we hear Set in Java, we should think non-repetitive elements.

* Sets divide into 3 parts. These are;
    1. HashSet:
        a. Super-fast; HashSet doesn't use sorting technique. That is, elements added into HashSet are sorted randomly.
        b. HashSet doesn't allow repetitive elements.
        c. HashSet accepts just one "null" as an element.
    2. LinkedHashSet
        a. Fast; LinkedHashSet uses sorting technique called insertion order. That is, elements added into LinkedHashSet
           are sorted by insertion order(by given order). For this reason, LinkedHashSet is slower than HashSet because
           of using sorting technique(insertion order).
        b. LinkedHashSet doesn't allow repetitive elements.
        c. LinkedHashSet accepts just one "null" as an element.
    3. TreeSet
        a. Slow; TreeSet uses sorting technique called naturel order. That is, elements added into TreeSet are sorted by
           naturel order(smallest to largest or alphabetical order). For this reason, TreeSet is the slowest Set because
           of using naturel order.
        b. TreeSet doesn't allow repetitive elements.
        c. TreeSet doesn't accept "null" as an element.

    Note: TreeSet is too slow adding element, but HashSet too fast. So we can use HashSet to add elements and then convert
    HashSet to TreeSet. Thus, we can avoid this negative aspect of TreeSet.

* "Hash" is a technique to create unique data. Java uses also this technique. In this technique, Java gives hash code for
each date. Data can be repetitive, but hash code cannot.

* Methods are divided into 2 parts in Java. These are;
    1. Normal Methods: Normal Methods are run with data types defined in parameters.
    2. Generic Methods: Generic Methods are run with all data types. Generic Methods return given data type.
