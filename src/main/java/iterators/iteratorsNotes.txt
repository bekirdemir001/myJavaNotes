* Iterators are new structure created Java to eliminate infinitive loop problem.

* Iterators do the same job as Loops. That is, iterators do all things loops do.

* Iterators process elements one by one, just like loops.

* There is no infinitive loop problem in Iterators, because Iterators don't use "starting or ending point" and "decrement
or increment".

* There is no performance difference between Loops and Iterators. But Iterators are more successful than Loops to remove
or update elements

* Iterators have two parts;
    1. Iterator;
        a. We can just remove the element.
        b. Iterator runs from left to right. That is, Iterator is one way.
    2. ListIterator:
        a. We can remove, update and add the element.
        b. ListIterator runs both from left to right and from right to left. That is, ListIterator is both way.

* If we remove or update any element in a Collection, it is recommended to be used Iterator.
