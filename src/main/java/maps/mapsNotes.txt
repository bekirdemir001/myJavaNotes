* Map is a data structure to store data like key and value.

* Map's features;
    1. Keys must be unique, but value can be repeatedly.
    2. Each data stored in Maps is called "entry", not element.
    3. Entries are unique because of keys in Maps.

* Maps have 3 parts;
    1. HashMaps;
        a. Super-fast; HashMaps don't spend time to sort entry.
        b. Just one null is used for keys, but more than one null is used for values.
        c. HashMaps aren't "tread-safe" and "synchronized".
    2. HashTables;
        a. Fast; HashTable don't spend time to sort entry, but slower than HashMaps.
        b. HashTables don't allow to use null for both key and value.
        c. HashTables are "tread-safe" and "synchronized".
    3. TreeMaps;
        a. Slow; TreeMaps spend a lot of time to sort entry by naturel order.
        b. TreeMaps don't allow null for keys, but allow more than one null for values.
        c. TreeMaps aren't "tread-safe" and "synchronized".

* HashMap Mechanism;
    1. Java creates 16 bucket when we create an HashMap and gives 0 to 15 index number to the buckets.
    2. When we use put() method, Java;
        a. creates hash code for key
        b. divides into 16.
        c. puts this entry into bucket that is equal to the remainder number
        d. can put more than one entry into bucket, because Java uses LinkedList in buckets.
