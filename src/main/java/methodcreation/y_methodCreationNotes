            METHOD CREATION
* Stages of creating methods;
    1. They are created out of Main Method.
    2. Syntax: Access Modifier + Return Type + Method Name + () + {}
       Access Modifier --> Restrict the access of a method
       Return Type     --> The type of the data which method produces
       Method Name     --> Starts with lowercase, the other words start with uppercase
       ()              --> Method parenthesis; we type parameters we use in the method in it.
       {}              --> Method Body; we type our codes in it.
    3. They are called in the Main Method.
    4. We type method name and "()" in the Main Method.
    5. We type argument or arguments into "()".
