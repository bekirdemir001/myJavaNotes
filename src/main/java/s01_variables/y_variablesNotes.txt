            VARIABLES
* Variable is the name of reserved area allocated in the memory.

* A variable is a container which holds the value while the java program is executed.

* Variable Declaration
    For single s01_variables;
        Data Type   VariableName    Statement End
           int          age             ;
           char        initial          ;
    For multiple s01_variables with the same data type;
        Data Type     VariableName          Statement End
           int      age, weight, length          ;

* Variable Assignment
        Data Type   VariableName    Statement End       -->      Variable Declaration
           int          age             ;

        VariableName    Assignment Operator   Value    Statement End        -->     Variable Assignment
           age                =               13          ;

* Variable Creation
    Data Type   VariableName    Assignment Operator   Value    Statement End
      int           age                =               13          ;

* Variable Declaration and Variable Assignment can be done in different ways like;
    1. int age;
       age = 33;
    2. int age, weight, height;
       age = 33;
       weight = 78
       height = 173;
    3. int age = 33, weight = 78, height = 173;
