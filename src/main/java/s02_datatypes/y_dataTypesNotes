            DATA TYPES
* A data type is a classification of data.

* Data types refer to the type of value that a variable has.

* There are two data types in Java.
    1. Primitive Data Types
    2. Non-Primitive Data Types

* Features of Primitive Data Types;
    1. They are created by Java and we cannot create. There are 8 Primitive Data Types in Java.
    2. Their names start with lower case.
    3. They occupy different areas in the memory depending on the data type.
    4. They have just values.

* Primitive Data Types;
    1. char;
        * It is used only single character. For example; A, X, ?, 5
        * Values are put into single quotes.
    2. boolean;
        * It takes just two values, true and false. For example; isRetired
        * Boolean values are mostly used for conditional situations.
    3. byte;
        * It is used for integer from -128 to +127. For example; studentAge
        * It occupies 1 byte of memory.
    4. short;
        * It is used for integer from -32768 to +32767. For example; populationOfApartment
        * It occupies 2 byte of memory.
    5. int;
        * It is used for integer from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647. For example; populationOfCountry
        * It occupies 4 byte of memory.
    6. long;
        * It is used for integer from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,807. For example;
        cellNumberInHumanBody
        * It occupies 8 byte of memory.
        * If a value is in long data type, we should add "L" or "l" at the end of that value.
        * If a value is between int boundaries, there is no need to add "L" or "l". Java accepts that value as int to protect
        memory.
    7. float;
        * It is used for decimal numbers. For example; the price of products
        * It occupies 4 byte of memory.
        * Java accepts decimal numbers as double automatically. If we create float variable, we should type "F" or "f" at the
        end of the value.
    8. double;
        * It is used for decimal numbers. For example; the weight of a cell
        * It occupies 8 byte of memory.

* Features of Non-Primitive Data Types;
    1. They are created by both Java and developers. So, there are infinite Non-Primitive Data Types in Java.
    2. Their names start with upper case.
    3. They occupy the same areas in the memory without depending on the data type.
    4. They have values and methods.

*Non-Primitive Data Types;
    1. String
    2. Array
    3. List
    4. Class etc.

* Differences between Primitive Data Types and Non-Primitive Data Types:
    1. Primitive has just value.
       Non-Primitive has value and methods.
    2. Primitive starts with lower case.
       Non-Primitive starts with upper case.
    3. Primitive Data Types are created by Java. There are 8 Primitive Data Types.
       Non-Primitive Data Types are created by both Java and developers. There are infinite Non-Primitive Data Types.
    4. Primitive Data Types occupy different areas in the memory depending on the data type.
       Non-Primitive Data Types occupy the same areas in the memory without depending on the data type.
