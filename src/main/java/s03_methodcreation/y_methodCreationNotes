            METHOD CREATION
* Stages of creating methods;
    1. They are created out of Main Method.
    2. Syntax: Access Modifier + Return Type + Method Name + () + {}
       Access Modifier --> Restrict the access of a method
       Return Type     --> The type of the data which method produces
       Method Name     --> Starts with lowercase, the other words start with uppercase
       ()              --> Method parenthesis; we type parameters we use in the method in it.
       {}              --> Method Body; we type our codes in it.
    3. They are called in the Main Method.
    4. We type method name and "()" in the Main Method.
    5. We type argument or arguments into "()".

* We must type return keyword and the data which method produces at the bottom of Method Body.

* If a methods doesn't create any data, we should use "void" as Return Type. Also if a method has a "void" Return Type,
there is no need to type return keyword and the data which method produces at the bottom of Method Body.
