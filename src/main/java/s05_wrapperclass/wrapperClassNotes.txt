            WRAPPER CLASS
* Non-Primitive Data Types have value and methods, but Primitive Data Types don't.

* Sometimes we need both value and its methods in Primitive Data Types. For this reason Java created Wrapper Classes.

* Primitive:       char    - boolean - byte - short -   int   - long - float - double
  Wrapper Class: Character - Boolean - Byte - Short - Integer - Long - Float - Double

* Wrapper Classes are Non-Primitive Data Types. So their names starts with upper case and they occupy more area than
Primitive Data Types. That's why, we should not prefer to use Wrapper Classes, if it is not necessary.

    Autoboxing-Unboxing
* If we need methods of Wrapper Class for any Primitive Data Type, we use Autoboxing. For example;
    int number = 22;
    Integer wrapperNumber = number;

* If we need just Primitive Data Type for any Wrapper Class, we use Unboxing. For example;
    Boolean isOld = false;
    boolean isOldWrapper = isOld;
