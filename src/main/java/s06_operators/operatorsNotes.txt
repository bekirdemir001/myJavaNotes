            OPERATORS
* Java has four type operators.
    1. Mathematical Operators;
        a. Addition (+) --> As in Maths
        b. Subtraction (-) --> As in Maths
        c. Multiplication (*) --> As in Maths
        d. Division (/) --> As in Maths
        Note: If we use a different data type in mathematical operations, Java give the result in big data type. For example,
            int / int = int
            double * int = double

    2. Logical Operators;
        a. And (&&)
            true && true = true
            true && false = false
            false && true = false
            false && false = false
        b. Or (||)
            true && true = true
            true && false = true
            false && true = true
            false && false = false
        c. Not (!)
            !true = false
            !false = true

    3. Comparison Operators;
        a. Less than (<) --> As in Maths
        b. Greater than (>) --> As in Maths
        c. Less than or equal to (<=) --> As in Maths
        d. Greater than or equal to (>=) --> As in Maths
        e. Equal Sign or Comparison Operator (==)
        f. Not Equal Sign (!=)

    4. Assignment Operator;
        "=" is an Assignment Operator. It takes the value on the right and puts into the container on the left. For example,
        int name = "Bekir";

* Note: Differences between "=" and "==";
    1. "=" is equal operator in Maths, but assignment operator in Java.
    2. "==" is equal operator in Java

* Note: Comparison Operators always give us boolean result.

* Note: Differences between "&" and "&&";
    1. Java doesn't control the others if it finds the first statement false when using "&&". So "&&" is fast.
    2. Java controls all statements whatever their values are when using "&". So "&" is slow.
    Tip: "&&" is recommended.
