            TYPE CASTING
* Type Casting is to convert Numeric Primitive Data Types to each other.

*  Numeric Primitive Data Types --> byte - short - int - long - float - double

* Auto Widening is to convert from small data types to large data types. Java do AutoWidening automatically.

* Explicit Narrowing is to convert from large data types to small data types. This operation is riskly. So Java do not
Explicit Narrowing automatically. This operation should be done by developer.

* If we use Explicit Narrowing with large number from converted data types boundaries, Java do Modulus operation with
that number and give the result of Modulus operation.
