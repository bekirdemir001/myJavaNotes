            SWAP OPERATIONS
* Swap is an operation to replace two values. For example;
    Before Swap Operation;
        int firstNumber = 8;
        int secondNumber = 17;
    After Swap Operation;
        int firstNumber = 17;
        int secondNumber = 8;

* Swap Operation is done 2 ways;
    1. Way; Using temporary variable
    2. Way; Mathematical operations
