            IF STATEMENTS
* We use If Statements to run some codes, according to some conditions. For instance;
    if you study hard, you will learn Java.

* If Statements are consisted of four parts.
    1. If Statement
    2. If Else Statement
    3. If Else If Statement
    4. Nested If Statement

* When we use If Statements, it is important to put codes in order. For instance;
    Codes of the following conditions are asked with us;
        For 0-4 baby
        For 5-10 child
        For 11-20 teenagers
        For 21-30 young
        For 31-over adult
    We must start to type our codes negative numbers. That is, ordering is important for If Statements.

* Nested If is Time-Consuming. So, we don't use Nested If as it possible.

* It is important to be simple inside "if" parenthesis in If Statements. If a statement inside "if" parenthesis is large,
we assign it to a boolean variable and then put this variable name into "if" parenthesis.
