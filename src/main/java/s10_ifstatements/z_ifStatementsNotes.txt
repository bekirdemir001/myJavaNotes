* When we use If Statements, it is important to put codes in order. For instance;
    Codes of the following conditions are asked with us;
        For 0-4 baby
        For 5-10 child
        For 11-20 teenager
        For 21-30 young
        For 31-over adult
    We must start to type our codes negative numbers. That is, ordering is important for If Statements.
