            TERNARY
* Ternary does the same job as if else.

* Ternary's syntax is different from if else. It is shorter, more simple and easier to read code.

* Ternary is consisted of two parts;
    1. Ternary
        Condition ? Condition true : Condition false;
    2. Nested Ternary
        Condition ? (Condition1 ? Condition1 true : Condition1 false;) : (Condition2 ? Condition2 true : Condition2 false;);

* If we use Ternary with different data types, we can use Object Class as a data type.
