            SWITCH STATEMENTS
* Switch Statements do the same job as if else.

* The syntax of Switch Statements is different from if else. It is more simple and easier to read code.

* Switch Statements are consisted of four parts:
    1. switch(Condition) --> Just as if(Condition)
    2. cases and operation codes --> The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
                                     If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
    3. break keyword --> When Java reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
    3. default and operation codes --> The default keyword contains some code to run if there is no case match

* When any operation is run with Strings without paying attention to a lower letter or upper letter, we use toLowerCase()
or toUpperCase() methods.

* In Switch we can use String, int, byte, short and char.
  We cannot use long, boolean, float, double

* There is no need to type "break" keyword if we use the default keyword in Switch Statements.
