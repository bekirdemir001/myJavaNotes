            LOOPS
* Loops are used when the same steps are done over and over again.

* Loops are consisted of four parts;
    1. For-Loop
    2. While-Loop
    3. Do-While-Loop
    4. For-Each-Loop

* Standards for typing code;
    1. Repetition is not good.
    2. Codes should be dynamic
    3. Fix and update should be easy
  If we don't obey the code standards, we type "hard code".

* There are three things in Loops:
    1. Starting point
    2. Ending point
    3. Increment or decrement

* If "break" keyword is used in Loops, it breaks out of the Loops.

* "continue" keyword provides to skip Loop steps for some conditions.

* Nested Structures are time-consuming. So, we should avoid using Nested Loops.
