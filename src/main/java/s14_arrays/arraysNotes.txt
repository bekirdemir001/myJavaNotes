* Arrays structure provide to store multiple data.

* How to create Arrays
    1. Data Type
    2. Declare have many elements in Array

* The syntax of Arrays:
    1. String[] names = new String[5];
    2. Int numbers[] = new int[6];

* Arrays are created two ways:
    1. String arr[] = new String[5];
        arr[0] = "Math";
        arr[1] = "Science";
        arr[2] = "Music";
        arr[3] = "English";
        arr[4] = "Art";
    2. String arr[] = {"Math", "Science", "Music", "English", "Art"};

* Arrays are primitive structure, not primitive date type. Arrays are non-primitive date type.

* Arrays are fast and occupy a little space in memory because of primitive structure.

* Arrays have constant element number, so there is no deletion. So, if we want to delete elements, we should create new
Array, and move elements there.

* For-Each-Loop is used in Arrays unless otherwise required. For-Each-Loop always starts from the beginning. When we need
to come from the end, For-Loop or While-Loop is used.

* sort() method sorts numeric data types from smallest to largest (ascending order)
  sort() method sorts String data types alphabetically (alphabetical order)
    ascending order + alphabetical order = Natural Order
  sort() method sorts Array elements according to Natural Order.

* binarySearch() method is used to check whether an element is in an Array.
  Before using the binarySearch() method, we have to use the sort() method. If we do not use the sort() method,
the result we find will not be reliable.

* Important methods of Arrays:
    Arrays.toString(arrayName): To print Array
    Arrays.sort(arrayName): To sort elements of Array by naturel order.
    Arrays.binarySearch(arrayName, key): To control if an element exists. It is used with sort() method together.
