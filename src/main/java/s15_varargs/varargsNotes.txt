            VARARGS
* Varargs means variable arguments.

* Sometimes we need flexibility for typing parameters when creating methods. For example, we want to create a method that
adds two numbers, or that adds three numbers, or that adds five numbers, etc. For this purpose, Java created Varargs Structure.

* Varargs is a new structure. It is not an Array or a List. But it uses Array logic in the background. We can say that
Varargs work like Array, but Varargs is a different structure.

* More than 1 Varargs parameter cannot be used in a method. Because the second one is "Unreachable (Unused) Code."

* Creating Varargs Structure:
        public void add (int... a){
            int sum = 0;
            for (int w : a){
                sum += w;
            }
            System.out.println(sum);
        }
