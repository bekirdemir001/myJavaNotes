            PASS BY VALUE - PASS BY REFERENCE
* PassByValue;
    * It means perform an operation using the value.
    * Here, the original value of the variable is preserved;
    * A copy is created in heap memory and operations are performed on the copy variable.
    * Then, this copy variable is assigned to another container and saved to memory.
    * Java uses PassByValue.
* PassByReference;
    * It means perform an operation using reference (address).
    * Here, the original value of the variable is NOT preserved;
    * A copy of the variable's reference is created in stack memory and operations are performed by accessing the variable
     through the copy reference.
    * In this case, the original value of the variable is changed.
  * C++ uses PassByReference.
