            STATIC KEYWORDS - STATIC BLOCKS
* Features of Static Keywords:
    1. Static Variable or static methods (Class Member) are common elements for all objects.
    2. All changes in Static Class Members affect all objects.
    3. Static Class Members are mounted to Class, non-Static Class Members are mounted to objects. For example; When we
    create 100 objects from a Class, non-Static ones are created 100 times, but static ones are created once, regardless
    of the number of objects.
    4. There is no need to create an object to access static class members, but it is necessary to create an object to access
    non-static class members.
    5. Another name for static variables is Class Variable. Another name for Non-Static Variables is Instance Variable or
    Object Variable.

* When a variable is created, if you do not assign a value, it means that you have not "initialized" that variable.

* If static variables are initialized in static blocks, they are made ready before anything else in that class.

* Sometimes variables need to be made ready before running the main method. Static blocks are used for this.

* Features of Static Blocks:
    1. Static Blocks are used to initialize static variables.
    2. Static Blocks are executed first of all in the class.
