            CONSTRUCTORS
* The code blocks that allow us to produce objects from a class are called Constructors.

* When we create a class, Java automatically gives a Constructor. But this constructor is not visible to the naked eye,
this constructor is called Default Constructor.

* When we create our own Constructor, Java deletes the Default Constructor.

* You can create as many Constructors as you want in a Class using different parameters.

* Thanks to different Constructors, we can create different objects from a Class.

* Difference between Method and Constructor:
    1. There is a "return type" in methods, but
       There is no "return type" in constructors.
    2. The names of the methods are determined by the developers according to the work they do.
       The name of Constructors must always be the same as the Class name.
